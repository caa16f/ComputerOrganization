# ComputerOrganization
Contains mainly projects written in C involving conversions between machine instructions and their 32 bit representations


Project 1 :  Reading in machine code and coverting it to its 32 bit representaions

My program can handle all instructions required. There should be no seg faults.
My program for the most part calculates the memory addresses corretly and most
of the machinecode although as you can see some commands generate invalid codes.
Mainly some I type instructions. I implemented all parts except some of the directives.
Everything else is either fully functional or implemented with problems


Project 2 :  

Shows the cycles that the MIPS processor takes to complete commands. 


Project 3 :
Simulates the MIPS Cache
