My program can handle all instructions required. There should be no seg faults.
My program for the most part calculates the memory addresses corretly and most
of the machinecode although as you can see some commands generate invalid codes.
Mainly some I type instructions. I implemented all parts except some of the directives.
Everything else is either fully functional or implemented with problems
